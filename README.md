###WHAT IS IT?

WBDB aka White Board Data Base is an APP built to sharpen the white boarding skills of software developers . WBDB does this by offering a comprehensive, search-able database of white boarding challenges.

###WHY SHOULD I SIGN UP?

Not only can you search for our desired white board challenge by tag, title, and question; but WBDB presents an interactive experience for our registered users. User accounts offer three distinct benefits on our User Dashboard: Favorites, Your Solutions, and Your Challenges.

FAVORITES:
Want to keep track of the challenges you are working on? Or maybe you want to keep a record of all the white boarding challenges you have complete.  WBDB's Favorites feature allows our users to do just that! Save any challenge to your favorites for future review on your personalized user dashboard.

YOUR SOLUTIONS:
Are you tired of cookie cutter solutions to white boarding problems? Or maybe you have been disappointed by the limited number of solutions that other resources offer. WBDB's users have the ability to share their individual solutions with WBDB community by submitting their personalized solutions. Get signed up and show off those white boarding skills by getting a solution published! WBDB will list you as the author of your solution when it is added to our database.

YOUR CHALLENGES:
Looking for a dynamic APP that is always growing and keeping up to date with the latest and greatest in white boarding challenges? Would you like to participate in furthering the collective growth of an entire community and take credit for your contributions? WBDB gives users the opportunity to purpose new challenges from their dashboard. If you already know that answer to your solution, submit the question and solution for review. Or you can even submit a question without a solution. When your question is published we will credit you as the author.

###HOW DOES WBDB MANAGE USER SUBMISSIONS?

Quality is important to the WBDB team and our users. Our admins are working overtime to ensure that only the best purposed challenges and solutions get published. Admins manage pending user submissions through an admin dashboard that streamllines the approval process. Submissions are organized into two sections: challenges and solutions. Your submissions can then be immediately posted to our database with the click of a button. The WBDB team created this dashboard to quickly and efficiently manage user submissions because we value your suggestions and hard work.

###HOW WILL I KNOW IF I GET PUBLISHED?

Your dashboard individually displays Your Challenges and Your Solutions with a label of Pending or Published. Before the admin team approves a submission, your challenge or solution will appear as Pending in red text on your Dashboard.  After approval, Pending is replaced by green text that reads Published.
